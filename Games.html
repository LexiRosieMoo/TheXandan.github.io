			<h1>Harmful Castle</h1>
			December 2016<br><br>
			
			<i>Harmful Castle</i> is a game that was made for a game design class throughout the Fall 2016 semester.<br>
			A smallish proof of concept for a Castlevania style game with a Megaman X-esque movement style<br><br>
			The game was designed and programmed by me and Alex McGrath.<br>
			Art for the game was made by Bruno Cohen and Aiden Hawkins.
			<br><br>
			I was very happy with the end result and I feel that it controls very smoothly and I enjoy playing it.<br>
			I have always been a fan of platformers so working on one so extensively let me really apply what I liked in my own way.<br>
			Controller Support is another cool plus.<br>

			<h1>Size Cube 3</h1>
			November 2016<br><br>
			
			<i>Size Cube 3</i> is a game that was made for a 48 hour game jam event.<br>
			Yet another addition to the Size Cube saga.<br>
			This game probably took the least amount of time for me to make but I did put a lot<br>
			of thought into it.  I do think that this is probably one of my more interesting game jam<br>
			submissions.
			<br>
			Very happy with this game.  I think that it breaks the mold enough to set a direction for<br>
			how I want to continue making games.<br>

			<h1>Size Cube 2: The Anime</h1>
			October 2016<br><br>
			
			<i>Size Cube 2: The Anime</i> is a game that was made for a 48 hour game jam event.<br>
			A continuation of the Size Cube series as a running joke among my friends and I.<br>
			The game has vastly different gameplay compared to the original Size Cube and is<br>
			pretty much a separate title entirely other than the story inclusions.<br>
			<br>
			Its interesting though a bit too difficult.  I may upload an easier version at some other point.<br>
			All in all a solid game in my eyes and an interesting application of ideas.<br>
			A big issue I have with this is project that despite it being different from what I normally make,
			I don't think I arranged my ideas in a way that makes a <i>fun</i> game.<br>

			<h1>Fodio: Dig and Prosper</h1>
			Spring 2016<br><br>
			
			Fodio: Dig and Prosper is a game made for a game design class I took during my Spring 2016 Semester.<br>
			Its an arcade style title reminicent of Dig-Dug.  The big difficulty with this project was making the<br>
			digging work properly.  I was very inexperienced in making this type of game and I believe that it was<br>
			a great learning experience for me.

			<h1>Size Cube</h1>
			Febuary 2016<br><br>
			
			<i>Size Cube</i> is a game that was made for a 48 hour game jam event<br>
			In this game you play as Size Cube on his quest to find the man<br>
			who killed his family.<br>
			<br>
			I like how it turned out though the controls are a bit wonky.<br>
			I realized that the mechanic of size changing was weird a bit too late into development and<br>
			didn't have enough time to make the gameplay more interesting.  The rather abrupt ending<br>
			was my way of saying "Alright, its 5AM and I need to wrap this up"<br>

			<h1>Tree Wars</h1>
			November 2015<br><br>
			
			Tree Wars is a game that was made for a 48 hour game jam event<br>
			I am very proud of how the game turned out and am proud of the final product<br>
			I hope I can continue improving by making games like this.<br>

			<h1>Door Simulator</h1>
			2014-Present<br><br>
			
			<i>Door Simulator</i> is an old project I started making when I was learning C++<br>
			in High School.  To put it simply, its a text based game about opening a door.<br>
			Every now and again I reopen the project to add more commands and recently put it on<br>
			Github to give a bit of version control to it.  I've also fooled around with porting it<br>
			to Gamemaker or some other graphical game engine but since the game is hardcoded in C++<br>
			transfering it is a slow process.  I have also been reworking a lot of old code in the<br>
			project since the base game was written before I knew what functions were.<br><br>
			I am really proud of this project and find incredible enjoyment out of having others play it.<br>
			I hope that I am able to call this project finished some day.<br>
			As for now it is available to download through my Github<br>

				<i>Rock Simulator</i> is a really old project I made when I was tinkering with Unity.<br>
				If I remember correctly, I wanted to see if I could assemble assets in a way that made a nice scenery.
				The project focused primarily on the aesthetics with no gameplay at all really.  I eventually ported this
				to Google Cardboard but the optimization is terrible.
