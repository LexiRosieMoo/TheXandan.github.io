	<p>I am Alex Huard, a 4th year CID student studying with a focus in game design.
	I have a bit of experience with web design, HTML, CSS, and Javascript but I
	do not have much HTML5 experience.</p><br><br>
	<p>As a Game Design student, I create a lot of hobby games and have participated
	in Game Jams in the Game Design Club at our school.  I hope to get a job in the
	game design industry after I graduate college.<br><br>
	</p>
	<p>In this class I hope to get more experience in web design so I can give my portfolio
	website a much needed facelift.  Currently it is on a site I built in highschool so 
	it is fairly poorly made.</p><br><br>
