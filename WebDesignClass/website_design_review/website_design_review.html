	<h1><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></h1>
	<hr>
	<p>The first website I would like to discuss is Google.  I'm sure we've all seen
	this page before but the front page of Google actually has a lot of neat design choices it makes.
	Firstly, there is a lot of blank space with the main elements being either in the center of the
	page or stuck to a corner.  This makes each element easier to find by the user with the most important
	being in the center.
	</p>
	
	<p>Google also makes an effort to have as little load time as possible.  This is why there are very few
	image elements save for the google logo/doodle and a profile icon on the top right of the page.  This is
	so that users will have to wait a very minimal amount of time to get into their page.

	<h1><a href="https://www.mtgstocks.com">MTGStocks</a></h1>
	<hr>
	<p>The next website I want to look at is MTGStocks, a website that visualizes the prices of Magic cards
	as if they were a stock market.  I like this website because it has all the information you need in a very
	easy to access manner.  The website also features a "stock ticker" of card prices to add to the stock market
	aesthetic.
	</p>
	
	<p>The top bar of their website is a slightly lighter black and then the colors get brighter as the page
	goes down ending with the main webpage content being on a white background.

	<h1><a href="http://hiagb.com/1">He is a Good Boy</a></h1>
	<hr>
	<p>He is a Good Boy is a comic Series by artist KC Green that follows the adventures of an acorn named Crange
	as he leaves his home for the first time.  The webpage has a very simple layout with the top bar being the
	title of the comic, beneath it having movement options for the comics, beneath that is the comic page itself,
	and finally is a note from the author to accompany the panel.
	</p>
	
	<p>The red and grainy texture from where the content begins gives the panel area a very material feel
	and gives the entire page a less artificial feel.  The comic is the main feature and as such, is front and center
	on the webpage.  This makes it the first thing any new visitor notices when they go onto the website.
